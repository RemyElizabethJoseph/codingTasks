# Supervised Learning-Decision Trees

## Introduction
In this task, we decribe tree-based methods for regression and classification. Tree based methods solve problems using a flowchart like structure that is easy to interpret. Here, I have created a decision tree to predict the suvival of passengers on the Titanic. I have used "titanic.csv" data set to complete the task. After the datacleaning I have initialized dependent and independent variables afrom the data and split data into training, testing  and development sets and plotted a decision tree using the training set. Created  train and dev accuracy lists in range 2-10 of max_depth values and plotted them against max_depth values to find the best max_depth value. Decision trees make choices through binary splits which makes it easier to make the decisions and also decision trees can handle large datasets and increased volumns of data without sacrificing prediction speed or accuracy

## Installation guide for python Libraries

###Jupyter notebook
The jupyter notebook is an open source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visuallisations and narrative text.    
We could install Jupyter note book by entering the command " pip install jupyter"

###Scikit learn
Scikit Learn is an open-source Python library that implements a range of machine learning, preprocessing, cross-validation, and visualization algorithms using a unified interface.
We can use the command " pip install -U scikit learn" to install Scikit learn 

### matplotlib
Matplotlib is a Python 2D plotting library which produces publication quality figures in a variety of hardcopy formats and interactive enviornments across platforms. We can install matplotlib by running the command "python -m pip3 install -U matplotlib"
