# Supervised Learning-Decision Trees
In this task, we decribe tree-based methods for regression and classification. Tree based methods solve problems using a flowchart like structure that is easy to interpret. Here, I have created a decision tree to predict the suvival of passengers on the Titanic. I have used "titanic.csv" data set to complete the task. After the datacleaning I have initialized dependent and independent variables afrom the data and split data into training, testing  and development sets and plotted a decision tree using the training set. Created  train and dev accuracy lists in range 2-10 of max_depth values and plotted them against max_depth values to find the best max_depth value. Decision trees make choices through binary splits which makes it easier to make the decisions and also decision trees can handle large datasets and increased volumns of data without sacrificing prediction speed or accuracy
## Installation guide for python Libraries

Jupyter notebook
The jupyter notebook is an open source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visuallisations and narrative text.    
We could install Jupyter note book by entering the command " pip install jupyter" 

We have to import the following Libraries to run the code
pandas
numpy
sklearn
matplotlib
subprocess
